# 100daysofcodecpp
100 Days of C++ Code

Goal:

Primary- Code for at least 1 hour for 100 days.
Secondary- Gain deeper C++ knowledge.

Method:

Each 20 day block will be seperated into different levels of difficulty based on the categorization of https://edabit.com/challenges/cpp. 

Day 1-19: Easy
Day 20-39: Normal
Day 40-59: Hard
Day 60-79: Very Hard
Day 80-100: Extremely Hard

I will give myself 1 hour each day to work on any question selected from the list, and store my progress in the appropriate folder.

Time spent, over or under, will be noted.

If I cannot complete the problem using the resources available to me, I will mark it as incomplete and revisit it at the end of the 100 Days.
