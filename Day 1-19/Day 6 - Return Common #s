/*
Create a function that takes in two sorted vectors of unique numbers and returns an array of numbers which are common to both input vectors.
Try doing this with O(n+m) time efficiency.

Extra challenge: I want to do this with an unsorted vector.

Notes: Inititial thought is to ceate two pointers to the vectors and loop through both, comparing the pointers.
If I move them at the same time, it doesn't work for an unsorted list, and if I loop one before I move the other,
it has exponential time complexity. Hmm...

1. To create a random number, we need a random number engine. mt19937 is a relatively fast engine with good quality.
2. As in, every value has an equal chance to be chosen. So a distribution of (1, 10) means every value from 1 to 10 has an equal chance to be chosen.

I spent today learning <random> and setting up a randomArray generation function.
